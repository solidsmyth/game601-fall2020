        “Loyalty or Treachery” is a modified and expanded version of the card game “Red or Black.” Two players face off against one another by drawing from the same deck, guessing the color of the card prior to drawing. Guessing correctly means they have the chance to manipulate the state of the game. Guessing incorrectly means they pass that chance, and card, over to the other player. When the main deck is gone, the player with the most cards wins.
